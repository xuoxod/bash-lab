Creating your own Bluetooth discovery program in C can range from relatively simple to extremely complex, depending on your goals:

Simple Discovery (Basic Functionality):

Complexity: Moderate
Features:
Scan for nearby Bluetooth devices.
Retrieve basic information like MAC address and device name.
No connection or data transfer.
Libraries: You can use the libbluetooth library (part of Bluez) for basic Bluetooth operations.
Example: The code snippet provided in the previous response demonstrates this level of complexity.
Advanced Discovery (More Features):

Complexity: High
Features:
More detailed device information (e.g., device type, service UUIDs).
Filtering devices based on specific criteria.
Handling Bluetooth events (e.g., device appearance, connection status).
Potentially connecting to devices and exchanging data.
Libraries: You'll likely need to delve deeper into the libbluetooth library and potentially use other Bluez libraries.
Example: You'd need to write more complex code to handle events, filter devices, and potentially manage connections.
Full-Featured Bluetooth Stack (Like Bluez):

Complexity: Extremely High
Features:
Implementing all layers of the Bluetooth protocol stack.
Handling device pairing, authentication, and encryption.
Supporting various Bluetooth profiles (e.g., A2DP, HID, SPP).
Interfacing with different Bluetooth adapters.
Libraries: You'd need to write your own libraries or use a third-party Bluetooth stack implementation.
Example: This is a massive undertaking and is generally not recommended unless you have a very specific need.
Key Considerations:

Bluetooth Specification: Understanding the Bluetooth specification is crucial for any Bluetooth programming.
Hardware Abstraction: You'll need to handle different Bluetooth adapters and their drivers.
Kernel Interaction: You might need to interact with the Linux kernel using APIs like Netlink.
Security: Implementing Bluetooth security features is essential to prevent vulnerabilities.
Recommendation:

For most use cases, using the libbluetooth library is the most practical approach. It provides a good balance of functionality and complexity. If you need more advanced features, you can explore other Bluez libraries or consider using a third-party Bluetooth stack implementation

-----------------------
Install Bluetooth Libraries: You'll need the Bluetooth development libraries. On Debian/Ubuntu-based systems:

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libbluetooth-dev 
sudo apt-get install libbluetooth-utils

Compile: Use a C compiler (like GCC) to compile the code:

gcc -o btdisc btdisc.c -lbluetooth

This creates an executable file named btdisc.

Run: Execute the program:

sudo ./btdisc 

Using as a Library

    1. Create a Header File (btdisc.h):
        #ifndef BTDISC_H
        #define BTDISC_H

        void discover_devices(); 

        #endif 

    2. Modify btdisc.c:
        - Add #include "btdisc.h" at the top.

    3. Compile as a Shared Library:
        gcc -c -fPIC btdisc.c -o btdisc.o -lbluetooth
        gcc -shared -o libtdisc.so btdisc.o -lbluetooth

    4. Using the Library:
        In your main program (e.g., main.c):
        #include "btdisc.h"

        int main() {
            discover_devices();
            return 0;
        }

        Compile and Link:
            gcc main.c -o main -L. -ltdisc -lbluetooth

            -L. tells the linker to look in the current directory for libraries.
            -ltdisc links against your libtdisc.so.

        Run:
            sudo LD_LIBRARY_PATH=. ./main 
            
                LD_LIBRARY_PATH=. tells the system to look in the current directory for shared libraries.

gcc btdisc.c -o btdisc -lbluetooth

-----------------------

1. Create a Shared Library

    Compile as a Shared Object:

        gcc -c -fPIC libbluetoothdiscovery.c -o libbluetoothdiscovery.o
        gcc -shared -o libbluetoothdiscovery.so libbluetoothdiscovery.o -lbluetooth

(Optional) Move to Standard Location: For system-wide access, move the library to a standard directory:

    sudo mv libbluetoothdiscovery.so /usr/local/lib/ 
    sudo ldconfig  # Update the linker cache

2. Using the Library

    a) In a C Program

        1. Include Header:

            #include "libbluetoothdiscovery.h" 

            int main() {
                // ... your code using the library ...
            }

        2. Compile and Link:

            gcc your_program.c -o your_program -L/path/to/library -lbluetoothdiscovery -lbluetooth -pthread

        -L/path/to/library: Tells the compiler where to find libbluetoothdiscovery.so.
        -lbluetoothdiscovery: Links your library.
        -lbluetooth: Links the Bluetooth library.
        -pthread: Links the POSIX threads library (if using threads).

    b) In a Bash Script (Using C Wrapper)

        1. Create a C Wrapper: (wrapper.c)

            #include <stdio.h>
            #include "libbluetoothdiscovery.h"

            int main() {
                if (bluetooth_init() != BT_SUCCESS) {
                    fprintf(stderr, "Bluetooth initialization failed.\n");
                    return 1;
                }

                if (bluetooth_start_discovery() != BT_SUCCESS) {
                    fprintf(stderr, "Discovery start failed.\n");
                    return 1;
                }

                // Sleep to allow for discovery
                sleep(5); 

                if (bluetooth_stop_discovery() != BT_SUCCESS) {
                    fprintf(stderr, "Discovery stop failed.\n");
                    return 1;
                }

                int num_devices;
                BluetoothDevice *devices = bluetooth_get_devices(&num_devices);
                if (devices == NULL) {
                    fprintf(stderr, "Failed to get devices.\n");
                    return 1;
                }

                for (int i = 0; i < num_devices; i++) {
                    printf("Address: %02x:%02x:%02x:%02x:%02x:%02x  Name: %s\n",
                        devices[i].address.b[0], devices[i].address.b[1],
                        devices[i].address.b[2], devices[i].address.b[3],
                        devices[i].address.b[4], devices[i].address.b[5],
                        devices[i].name);
                }

                bluetooth_free_devices(devices);
                return 0;
            }

        2. Compile the Wrapper:

            gcc wrapper.c -o bt_discover -L/path/to/library -lbluetoothdiscovery -lbluetooth -pthread

        3. Call from Bash:

            #!/bin/bash
            sudo ./bt_discover

    c) In Python (Using ctypes)

        1.Load the Library:

            import ctypes
            import time

            # Load the shared library
            lib = ctypes.CDLL('/path/to/library/libbluetoothdiscovery.so')

            # Define argument and return types for the functions you'll use
            lib.bluetooth_init.restype = ctypes.c_int
            lib.bluetooth_start_discovery.restype = ctypes.c_int
            lib.bluetooth_stop_discovery.restype = ctypes.c_int
            lib.bluetooth_get_devices.restype = ctypes.POINTER(ctypes.c_char_p)
            lib.bluetooth_free_devices.argtypes = [ctypes.POINTER(ctypes.c_char_p)]

            # ... rest of your Python code ...

        2. Call Library Functions:

            # ... (previous code) ...

            class BluetoothDevice(ctypes.Structure):
                _fields_ = [("address", ctypes.c_char * 18), 
                            ("name", ctypes.c_char * 248)]

            if lib.bluetooth_init() != 0:
                print("Bluetooth initialization failed.")
                exit(1)

            if lib.bluetooth_start_discovery() != 0:
                print("Discovery start failed.")
                exit(1)

            time.sleep(5)  # Allow time for discovery

            if lib.bluetooth_stop_discovery() != 0:
                print("Discovery stop failed.")
                exit(1)

            num_devices = ctypes.c_int(0)
            devices_ptr = lib.bluetooth_get_devices(ctypes.byref(num_devices))

            if devices_ptr:
                devices = [BluetoothDevice(ctypes.cast(devices_ptr + i * ctypes.sizeof(BluetoothDevice), 
                                                    ctypes.POINTER(BluetoothDevice)).contents) 
                        for i in range(num_devices.value)]

                for device in devices:
                    print(f"Address: {device.address.decode()}  Name: {device.name.decode()}")

                lib.bluetooth_free_devices(devices_ptr)
            else:
                print("Failed to get devices.")
