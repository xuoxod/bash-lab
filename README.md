# ðŸ§ª Code Laboratory ðŸ§ª

Welcome to my coding playground! This repository is a space for me to experiment with different programming languages, tools, and concepts. Think of it as a digital workbench where I tinker with code, explore new technologies, and push my programming boundaries.

## Current Experiments

Right now, I'm diving into:

- **Bash Scripting:** Automating tasks, managing the system, and generally bending the command line to my will.
- **Python Development:** From web scraping to data analysis, Python's versatility is endlessly fascinating.
- **C Development:** Getting down to the nitty-gritty of systems programming and low-level interactions.

## Projects

- **Bluetooth Device Discovery (C):** This project focuses on using the Bluez library (`libbluetooth`) to create a program that scans for and lists nearby Bluetooth devices. It explores concepts like:
  - Bluetooth protocol basics
  - Socket programming in C
  - Working with C libraries
  - Hardware interaction (Bluetooth adapter)

## Development Environment

Here's a glimpse into the tools I'm currently using:

- **Code Editor:** Visual Studio Code (v1.82.2)
- **C Compiler:** GCC (v11.3.0)
- **Bash Shell:** Bash (v5.1.16)
- **Python:** Python (v3.10.6)
- **Bluetooth Libraries:** Bluez (v5.63)

## Contributing

While this is primarily a personal learning space, I'm always open to feedback and suggestions. Feel free to open an issue if you have any ideas or spot any areas for improvement!

Let's build something awesome together! ðŸš€
