# ðŸ§ª Code Laboratory ðŸ§ª

Welcome to my coding playground! This repository is a space for me to experiment with different programming languages, tools, and concepts. Think of it as a digital workbench where I tinker with code, explore new technologies, and push my programming boundaries.

## Current Experiments

Right now, I'm diving into:

- **Bash Scripting:** Automating tasks, managing the system, and generally bending the command line to my will.
- **Python Development:** From web scraping to data analysis, Python's versatility is endlessly fascinating.
- **C Development:** Getting down to the nitty-gritty of systems programming and low-level interactions.

## Projects

### NetSage: Your Network Oracle

NetSage is a versatile network scanning tool built in Python. It offers multiple scanning methods, including pure Python, Nmap integration, and Scapy-based scanning, providing flexibility and efficiency for network exploration and security auditing.

#### Features

- **Multiple Scanning Methods**
  - **Pure Python:** Fast and lightweight scanning using native sockets.
  - **Nmap Integration:** Leverages the power and features of Nmap for comprehensive scans.
  - **Scapy-Based Scanning:** Provides packet-level control for advanced network analysis.
- **Customizable Configuration:** Configure default ports, timeouts, Nmap arguments, and output formats.
- **User-Friendly Output:** Results are presented in clear text, CSV, or JSON format.
- **Extensible Design:** Easily integrate new scanning modules and functionalities.

#### Requirements

- **Python 3.6 or higher**
- **Nmap (optional, for `nmapscan` command)**: Install Nmap from [https://nmap.org/](https://nmap.org/)
- **Scapy (optional, for `scapyscan` command)**: Install Scapy with `pip install scapy`

#### Installation & Usage

(Recommended) Create a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv project-dir:
cd project-dir

Activate the virtual environment:
source ./bin/activate

Deactivate the virtual environment (when done):
deactivate

Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/xuoxod/bash-lab.git
cd netsage

Detailed
    Important Notes:

    Python Version: Ensure you have Python 3.3 or later installed. You can check your version with python3 --version or python --version.
    Package Managers: Use your system's package manager (like apt, yum, brew) to install Python if it's not already available.

    1. Windows

        Using venv (Recommended for Python 3.3+)

        Open Command Prompt or PowerShell.
        Install venv (if not already included with Python):
        python -m ensurepip --upgrade
        That's it! venv is typically included with Python installations on Windows.
        Using virtualenv (Alternative)

        Open Command Prompt or PowerShell.
        Install virtualenv using pip:
        pip install virtualenv

    2. macOS

        Using venv (Recommended for Python 3.3+)

        Open Terminal.
        Install venv (if not already included with Python):
        /Applications/Python\ 3.x/Install\ Certificates.command
        (Replace 3.x with your Python 3 version)
        That's it! venv is typically included with Python installations on macOS.
        Using virtualenv (Alternative)

        Open Terminal.
        Install virtualenv using pip:
        pip install virtualenv

    3. Linux

        Using venv (Recommended for Python 3.3+)

        Open Terminal.
        Install venv (if not already included with Python):
        Debian/Ubuntu:
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install python3-venv
        Fedora/CentOS/RHEL:
        sudo yum install python3-venv
        That's it! venv is often included by default, but you might need to install it separately.
        Using virtualenv (Alternative)

        Open Terminal.
        Install virtualenv using pip:
        pip install virtualenv
        After Installation (Creating and Activating Environments):

        The process for creating and activating virtual environments is the same across platforms once you have either venv or virtualenv installed. Here's a quick guide:

        Navigate to your project directory:

        cd /path/to/your/project
        Create a virtual environment:

    4. Using venv:
        python3 -m venv .venv
        Using virtualenv:
        virtualenv .venv
        Activate the virtual environment:

        Linux/macOS:
        source .venv/bin/activate

        Windows:
        .venv\Scripts\activate

Usage
    - Scan a target host using pure Python scanning:
        - python netsage.py scan -t 192.168.1.1

    - Scan a target network using Nmap scanning:
        - python netsage.py scan -t 192.168.1.0/24 -m nmapscan

    - Scan a target network using Scapy scanning:
        - python netsage.py scan -t 192.168.1.0/24 -m scapyscan

    - Get help and see all options:
        - python netsage.py --help
        - python netsage.py scan --help
        - python netsage.py nmapscan --help
