Explanation:

Error Handling: The code includes robust error handling using try...except blocks to catch potential errors during port parsing, nmap execution, and output parsing. Specific error messages are printed to the console using colored output for better readability.
Threading: The _execute_nmap_scan method is designed to be run in a separate thread for each target IP address, allowing for concurrent scans.
Port Parsing: The _parse_ports method takes a string of ports and port ranges as input and converts it into a comma-separated string that can be used as an argument for nmap.
Output Parsing: The _parse_nmap_output method is currently a placeholder. You'll need to implement the logic to parse the XML output from nmap and extract relevant information about open ports and services.
Status Updates: The print_status, print_error, and print_warning methods provide colored output to the console, indicating the progress of the scan and any errors encountered.
Constructor Overloading: The __init__ method allows for the creation of CustomNmapScanner objects with different combinations of arguments, providing flexibility in how scans are initiated.
Next Steps:

Implement _parse_nmap_output: This method is crucial for extracting meaningful information from the nmap scan results. You'll need to use an XML parsing library to process the output and extract the desired data.
Enhance Output Formatting: The print_results method can be improved to provide more organized and informative output to the user. Consider using tables or other formatting techniques to present the scan results in a clear and concise manner.

Add Unit Tests: Write unit tests to ensure that the class methods are functioning correctly and to prevent regressions as you continue to develop the code.

This more complete draft incorporates error handling, threading, port parsing, and output parsing (placeholder), along with status updates and constructor overloading. Remember to replace the placeholder _parse_nmap_output implementation with your own logic to parse nmap's XML output.

How to Use:

Run app.py: Execute the app.py script.

Enter Targets: Provide one or more IP addresses, CIDR ranges, or network ranges separated by commas.
Select Scan Type: Choose a scan type from the displayed list by entering its number.

Select Common Ports (Optional): Enter the numbers corresponding to the common ports you want to scan, separated by commas. If you leave this blank, you'll be prompted to enter custom ports.

Enter Custom Ports (Optional): If you didn't select common ports, you can enter specific ports or port ranges here.

View Results: The scan results will be printed to the console.
Stop with Ctrl+C: Press Ctrl+C to interrupt the scan. The script will gracefully stop the scanner and exit.
